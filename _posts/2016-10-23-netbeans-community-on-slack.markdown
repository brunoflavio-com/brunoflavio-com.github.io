The NetBeans Dream Team is experimenting with slack as a way to keep in touch with the NetBeans community.

The slack url is [http://netbeans.slack.com/][nb-slack] and you can join us using the sign-up form [https://netbeans.signup.team/][nb-slack-signup].

In order to ensure we don’t alienate our existing IRC channel we’ve setup a bot to connect both communities.

## Topics

Once you join the NetBeans community on slack you’ll be able to join several channels:

 * ant-ide-users
 * apache-incubation
 * channel-requests
 * cpp-ide-users
 * gradle-ide-users
 * groovy-ide-users
 * html-js-web-ide-users
 * ide-users
 * irc-netbeans
 * java-ee
 * java-ide-users
 * maven-ide-users
 * nb-development
 * netbeans-day
 * netbeans-slack
 * php-ide-users
 * platform-ide-users
 * platform-users
 * plugin-developers
 * python-ide-users
 * spring-ide-users

## Activity

It’s still early to verify whether slack will be a success for our community, but we can already get a sense of the activity going on. Comparing the number of exchanged messages on both IRC and Slack seems to show that the community prefers to use Slack. Time will tell if this becomes a trend :-).
