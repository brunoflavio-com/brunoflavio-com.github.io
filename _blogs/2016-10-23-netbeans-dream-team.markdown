The NetBeans Dream Team has seven new members, and I’m excited to be one of them!

![Card]({{page.image}} "{{page.image-alt}}")

Since February 2015 I’ve been categorizing and fixing Groovy and Grails bugs as a NetBeans developer, and earlier this month Wade Chandler approached me to know whether I’d like to ‘apply’ to become a member of this community-driven group of highly skilled users and contributors. A vote was held and I’m now a part of the team, 6 others went through the process as well: Attila Kelemen, Emmanuel Hugonnet, Gaurav Gupta, Leonardo Zanivan, Michael Simons and Ryan Cuprak.
