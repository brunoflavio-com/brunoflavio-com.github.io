Spring has sprung and our Lego Wildflowers bouquet ([link ðŸ”—](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/wildflower-bouquet-10313){:target="_blank"}) was in desperate need of a vase! So, we turned to Thingiverse and found a very nice looking one: [Sergio MenÃ©ndez's giroid vase](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4899605){:target="_blank"}.

But, as with any good project, there were some unexpected challenges. The flowers turned out to be too heavy for the light vase, threatening to topple the whole display. We came up with a genius solution: we had a magnetic sculpture made of spheres that when repurposed to be the base of the vase added both weight and a touch of futuristic flair.

After a few more tweaks and some improvisation, the end result was stunning! Check it out:
