                                          <p>
                                                Hi there, I'm Bruno! I'm a technology enthusiast based in Portugal,
                                                where I live with my amazing wife and two energetic kids. When I'm not
                                                spending time with my family, you can usually find me tinkering with
                                                electronics and playing around with computers.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>
                                                Although I'm not big on video games, I've always been fascinated by
                                                technology and its endless possibilities. Whether it's experimenting
                                                with 3D printing to bring my ideas to life or exploring the latest
                                                developments in digital communications, I love staying up to date with
                                                the ever-evolving world of tech.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>
                                                In my downtime, I enjoy playing the piano (I took lessons for several
                                                years as a kid!) and finding new ways to be creative with my hands.
                                                Whether it's building elaborate Lego structures with my kids or flying
                                                radio-controlled monster trucks, I'm always up for a good challenge.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>
                                                Thanks for stopping by - I look forward to connecting with you!
